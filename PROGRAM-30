Sanjay wants to know whether the user input is Automorphic number or not.

For example,

    The Automorphic number is square of the number ends with the Same number. 
    Square of 5 is 25,its ends with the value of 5.
    so the number 5 is Automorphic Number.
could you please help him to find it and implements in program.

Input Format

Input consists of one integer
Constraints

Given N is greater than 1 and lesser than 9.

Output Format

Print the statement whether the given number is "Automorphic Number" or "Not Automarphic Number".
Sample Input 0

5
Sample Output 0

The Number 5.0 is Automorphic Number
Sample Input 1

9
Sample Output 1

The Number 9.0 is Not Automorphic Number
Sample Input 2

12
Sample Output 2

Invalid Input

num=int(input())
if num <= 1 or num > 9 or num != int(num):
    print("Invalid Input")
else:
    num = int(num)
    
    # Calculate square
    square = num * num
    
    # Check if square ends with the number
    # Convert both to strings and check if square ends with the number
    if str(square).endswith(str(num)):
        print(f"The Number {float(num)} is Automorphic Number")
    else:
        print(f"The Number {float(num)} is Not Automorphic Number")
