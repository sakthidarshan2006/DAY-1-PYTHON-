Kumar wants to learn how the calculators are working.so he is trying to implements the calculator program.could you please help him to implements the program. - Notes:- Must use the Switch Case.operators - Addition - Subtraction - Multiplication - Division - Modulo

Input Format

First input consists of integer.
Second input consists of integer.
third input consists of character.
Constraints

No Constraints

Output Format

print the calculation Value.
if the symbol is not the arithmetic operator,print the statement is "Invalid Input".
Sample Input 0

3
4
+
Sample Output 0

Addition of two number is 7.0
Sample Input 1

7
3
-
Sample Output 1

Subtraction of two number is 4.0
Sample Input 2

13
2
/
Sample Output 2

Division of two number is 6.5

# Get inputs
num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
operator = input().strip()

# Calculator using if-elif-else
if operator == '+':
    result = num1 + num2
    print(f"Addition of two number is {float(result)}")
elif operator == '-':
    result = num1 - num2
    print(f"Subtraction of two number is {float(result)}")
elif operator == '*':
    result = num1 * num2
    print(f"Multiplication of two number is {float(result)}")
elif operator == '/':
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 / num2
        print(f"Division of two number is {result}")  # Division already gives float
    else:
        print("Division by zero is not allowed")
elif operator == '%':
    if num2 != 0:
        result = num1 % num2
        print(f"Modulo of two number is {float(result)}")
    else:
        print("Modulo by zero is not allowed")
else:
    print("Invalid Input")
