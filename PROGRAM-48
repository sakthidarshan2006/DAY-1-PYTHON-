The program to find if the given numbers are Friendly pairs or not (Amicable or not) is discussed here. Friendly Pairs are two or more numbers with a common abundance.

For example,6 and 28 are Friendly Pairs.

    (Sum of divisors of given number1)/given number1 = (Sum of divisors of given number2)/given number2  
- sum of divisors for 6 is 1,2,3,6=(1+2+3+6)=12
- sum of divisors for 28 is 1,2,4,7,14,28=56
- (12/6)==(56/28).Its a Friendly Pair.
Input Format

Input consists of 2 integers.

Output Format

If it is a Friendly Pair display "Friendly Pair" or displays "Not Friendly Pair".
Sample Input 0

15
25
Sample Output 0

The Given Number 15 and 25 are Friendly Pairs.
Sample Input 1

8
30
Sample Output 1

The Given Number 8 and 30 are Not Friendly Pairs.

def sum_div(n):
    div_sum=0
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if(n%i == 0):
            div_sum+=i
    return div_sum
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
sum_1=sum_div(x)

sum_2=sum_div(y)

if int(sum_1/x) == int(sum_2/y):
    print(f"The Given Number {x} and {y} are Friendly Pairs.")
else:
    print(f"The Given Number {x} and {y} are Not Friendly Pairs.")
