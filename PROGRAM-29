Veena wants know to whether the given number is perfect number or not.could you please help her to find it and implements in program.

If the Sum of proper factor is equals to the given number,its a perfect number.
For example,Proper factor of 6 is 1,2,3=>(1+2+3)=6

    sum of factor is 6 and the given number is also 6 so its a perfect number.
Input Format

integer consists of one integer.
Constraints

Given N is Non Negative Numbers

Output Format

Invalid Input

num=int(input())
if num < 0 or num != int(num):
    print("Invalid Input")
else:
    num = int(num)
    
    # Special case: 0 and 1 are not perfect numbers
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        print(f"The Number {float(num)} is a Not Perfect Number.")
    else:
        # Find proper factors and sum them
        factor_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, num):
            if num % i == 0:
                factor_sum += i
        
        # Check if it's a perfect number
        if factor_sum == num:
            print(f"The Number {float(num)} is a Perfect Number.")
        else:
            print(f"The Number {float(num)} is a Not Perfect Number.")
